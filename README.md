NEED TO UPDATE STILL

(Update the README
Since .env.* files are ignored by Git, anyone who clones your project wonâ€™t have access to the required environment variables.
What you need to do:
Remove the link to the initial instructions in README.md.
Add instructions explaining how to set up the .env files:
Specify what files need to be created.
Explain what values need to be added for a developer to connect to both databases locally.)
